# **About Hidden Fence**

In 2019 we acquired Hidden Fence from the prior owner and plan to expand. We have ran a successful Construction company for 30 plus year and decided it was time to expand. Being the avid animal owners and lovers that we are we found this to be a great opportunity. We have signed on with Pet Stop and offer their award winning products. Pet Stop has a storied history with their top of the line products and service.



Ryan graduated from Ithaca College in the Spring of 2019 with a bachelors of science. Ryan was a business Management major and he also played football at Ithaca. Ryan has been trained by the former owner to ensure that he can bring the high standards that Pet Stop requires. He is excited about putting a personal touch on every family that he works with.
